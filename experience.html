        <h1>My Journey in Programming</h1>

            <h2>My Beginner's Experience</h2>
            <p>
                When I took my first Intro to Programming course at UCSD, I had zero prior experience with coding, so everything was new to me. 
                There were many peers in the course that had a little to moderate amounts of prior coding experience which was intimidating when 
                they were already familiar with some of the concepts that were completely foreign to me.
                However, whenever things went smoothly after much trial and error, it was always one of the best feelings as a beginner.

            <h2>A Major Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                My most discouraging moment was taking the second continuation of Intro to Programming where there was still a self struggle with 
                programming due to both comprehension issues and definitely not understanding everything that was crucial such as syntax or how the 
                language (in this case <em>Java</em>) works. 
                Usually being independent, I was always scared of asking for help, letting imposter syndrome settle in. As a result, not succeeding 
                or doing as well in the early stages of my programming classes.

            <h2>Overcoming My Challenge</h2>
            <p>
                While not doing well, or even failing (in my case), it almost felt like Computer Science was not the correct field for me. 
                As I retook my second intro class (even seeing tutors for help this time) and still did not have a satisfactory grade, 
                that lead to going further down the hole of imposter syndrome. 
                However, as discouraged I was at this point, I still decided to stay and retake the class for a third time.
                <em>This</em> is where things took a turn for better, I was finally able to understand parts of Java that I was not comprehending
                before. When I was able to see Java in full view, this allowed me to see similarities in other programming languages that scared 
                me in future classes because there was no exposure to such as C/C++. While I still have much to learn in both understanding software 
                programming and continuing my education in this field, I am no longer as helpless feeling as before.
